# leaflet-challenge

Obtained data from [USGS](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) database, I parsed through earthquake data over the magnitude of 4.5 from the past week. 
Using leaflet, I created a circle layer that reflect the magnitude of the earthquake. Hovering over each circle group will bring up a tool tip that shows the epicenter, magnitude, time, and depth of the earthquake. The legend on the right bottom corner of the map reflects the depth of the different earthquakes.
